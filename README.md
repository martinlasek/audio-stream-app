# Audio Stream App

## Description
For an iOS Position I was asked to implement a streaming app.
That app should update the artist, song name and cover image whenever the stream transitions to the next song.

This app is perhaps the most simplest implementation needed to get a streaming app up and running, have the ability to pause and even look nice.
